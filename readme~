What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

It was absolutely helpful!
I struggled in doing the extra challenge. At first, it was very
frustrating, and I totally lost confidence. However, after countless
debugging, testing and trial-and-errors, I finally got it working.
It is absolutely amazing that I can beat the compiler!
Although I had a really tough time doing this assignment, I learned so
much. Not just CS knowledge, but also the spirit of not giving up.
I assume that a lot of my classmates are going to complain about it,
but I like this assignment! Doing the extra challenge is totally
worth my time!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

It's my first time writing assembly, and I had a really hard time doing
the extra challenge. I studied the given instruction set very carefully
and used some instructions that are not taught in the lectures/precepts.

What is your mywc program test plan?

===============================================================
Test with input file mywcB0_empty.txt
===============================================================
Boundary test: This is an empty file.
It is testing the case where the while loop is not executed at
all. Also, since iInWord is FALSE, lWordCount will remain 0.
So everything will be 0 in this case.

===============================================================
Test with input file mywcB1_space.txt
===============================================================
Boundary test: This is a file containing only a space.
It is testing the case where there is only 1 char.
The program enters the while loop, and sees that it is a space,
and the space is not in word, so it does nothing else.

===============================================================
Test with input file mywcB2_one_char.txt
===============================================================
Boundary test: This is a file containing just one character.
The program enters the while loop, and sees that this is not a
space. Since the program is not in any word, it sets iInWord
to true. So there is 1 character and 1 word.

===============================================================
Test with input file mywcB3_newline.txt
===============================================================
Boundary test: This is a file containing just one newline
character. It goes into the while loop and sees that this is
exactly a newline character, and is not in any word. So we
have 1 line here.

===============================================================
Test with input file mywcSTMT.txt
===============================================================
Statement test: This is a file that tests every statement of
the program.

===============================================================
Test with input file mywcSTRS0.txt
===============================================================
Stress test: This is a large file containing randomly generated
characters.

===============================================================
Test with input file mywcSTRS1.txt
===============================================================
Stress test: This is a large file containing randomly generated
characters.
